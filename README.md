# Dylan Script

## Description

A small scripting language that I hope to grow into something larger

## Goals

 - Simple virtual machine

 - Decent module system

 - Static typing

 - Multithreading

 - General purpose, supporting functional and data-oriented code

 - There are four things I would add to C and want here:

    * operator overloading

    * default values (in functions & structs)

    * references & pointers (instead of just pointers)

    * modules (see above)

 - API to connect machine code to interpreted code for expanding system

 - "Better" python with types

## Running

`make` - Builds the interpreter

`dyl <filename>` - Runs the program <filename>
